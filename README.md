# Yelp Restaurant Rating Prediction

## Description
The goal of this project is to predict the Yelp rating score of a restaurant, given only its business features. This task is naturally a hard problem since we don't have information about food quality or review texts, but it is extremely valuable since we can predict the rating even before opening the restaurant business. We gather restaurant data from the Yelp API, analyze the gathered data via visualizations and statistical tests to identify the influential features, perform feature engineering and train different machine learning models.
